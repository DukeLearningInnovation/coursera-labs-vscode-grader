# Assignment 1

Start by implementing a helper function that appends an exclamation point (!) to whatever it is passed. To make sure you implemented it correctly, you can run the included test by opening a terminal and running:

```bash
$ python3 -m pytest
```

After you have this test passing, implement the greet function that returns `"Hello Bob!"` when you pass in "Bob". If you pass in nothing, it should return `"Hello World!"`.
